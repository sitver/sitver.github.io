<h3>This is the exact text of Moez Bhatti's Reddit post that propelled QKSMS to 200,000 downloads. 205 upvotes. 210 comments.</h3>
<p>Hello /r/Android! Today I want to show you what I've been working on for the last few months, and hopefully I can get some feedback from you.
First, a little bit about me and the background of QKSMS. Warning: Wall of text
My name's Moez, I'm 17 and I'm from Canada. About a year ago I started learning Android development in my free time, and I've loved it ever since. It has helped my to decide what direction I want to take with my life. Currently I'm trudging through the last few weeks of High School, but next year I'll be studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. When I first started to learn app development for Android I kept on starting projects that were overly ambitious, and never ended up finishing a single one. After about 6 months of getting nothing done I decided that I'll do something that's a small project, that I would be able to finish in a reasonable timeframe, say within a month. That's when I thought of QKSMS. As an Android user, I felt that one of the biggest things that the OS is lacking is QuickReply. I tried a few apps that had it, but I had various problems with each of them. Ugly UI, excessive advertisements, etc. I just wanted something lightweight, and felt like it was a part of the phone. I couldn't find anything like this that wasn't simply just built into a custom ROM, so I decided to make my own. The app was going to be called SMS QuickReply, and all it would do is serve as an extension of whatever SMS app you currently use, whether it be stock, touchwiz, anything. It would show popups for incoming messages that you can reply in, and if you wanted to see a full conversation or compose a new message then you would just use the other app for that. In a few weeks, I was able to finish the app, and I was very excited to publish it and see what people think
Then Android 4.4 was announced, and I wanted to pull my hair out. In the announcement Google said that on any phone running KitKat or higher, there would only be one app that's allowed to write to the SMS Content provider, and one app would receive the broadcasts for incoming messages. This means that If people wanted to use my app, then it would be impossible for them to compose new messages or reply from the conversation view of their regular app. At this point I could have either abandoned the project, or gone all out and made an entire SMS app. Since I'm writing this today, I think you probably know which option I picked. I've been working on it on and off for about 8 months now due to school, but recently with the relief that I've been accepted to my top choice in University I have had a lot more time to focus on it. I believe that it's finally at a point where I'm comfortable sharing it with others, though you should know that there are definitely some aspects of it that need some work.
Before I talk about that, I'll talk about the app itself. QKSMS is an SMS app that will replace your stock messaging client. It has a beautiful UI and it allows you to customize how it looks with different colour schemes. It also has a sliding interface, which I know a lot of people are fans of (including me). It doesn't just look good though, there is a big reason you want to get it! QuickReply. For those who don't know what QuickReply is, it's a way to allow you to respond to messages much faster than usual. When you receive a new message, it doesn't just show up in the notification bar. The message will pop up in front of the current app in a small dialog box (assuming you haven't disabled it), and this dialog box has a text field that you can type your reply into. With this, you don't need to go back and forth between what you're doing and the conversation you're having with someone.
Now, what you've all been waiting for. What does it look like??
Well, here are some screenshots

Later on I'll be creating some more professional looking screenshots using the emulator and fake contacts, but I've been having some problems with creating fake messages on the Emulator so I'm not going to worry about that until I'm closer to release. Also, these screenshots are much more up to date than the ones you'll see on Google Play, so just ignore those. I haven't updated them yet. In fact, the whole listing is pretty bad right now, but it's private so it's not a huge deal.
Anyway, I've created a Google+ community that has access to download the app, so if you'd like to try it out then just request to join this page and it will become available to you! I will not be rejecting anyone
CLICK HERE IF YOU WANT TO DOWNLOAD THE APP
Sorry for the all caps, that's just for all the people who don't feel like reading!
I am going to be working on the app pretty much all day today, so I'll be at my computer. If you request to join the page then you should be accepted within just a few minutes
Some things that you should know before downloading. Note: These are all things that I am going to be working on in the very near future.
MMS is NOT working at all. It's just something that I haven't implemented yet, as my phone plan does not include MMS and it's too expensive for me to upgrade currently. I do plan on adding it in the next few weeks however. If your phone is less than Android 4.4, then this is only a minor issue as the MMS will still go through your old MMS app, but for 4.4+ you will simply not receive them at all unfortunately.
The compose message screen is in a very early stage. It works without any major issues at all, you can use if you need to send a new message, but it is just lacking some functionality. When you send a message, the app won't show the correct conversation. The message will still send to the right person though, so you can just go to the conversation list and click on the correct one to see the message.
When you have multiple unread messages, the notification doesn't provide very much information. All it tells you is how many unread messages there are, and it shows a list of who sent them. It doesn't allow you to open the popup for a specific message, or even show you the actual messages. You just click on it and it takes you to the actual app. This is what I'm going to be working on today, so you may in fact see an update for this later tonight.
I'll be adding more to this list from user's comments, but these are what I feel to be the biggest annoyances with it right now.
But yes, please let me know what you guys think! I'm hoping that with your help in finding bugs and giving suggestions it will be a much more finished product when I publish it in the play store.
Thank you!

<h3>Moez's update post, which had 2792 upvotes and 1139 comments.</h3>
<p>Hey /r/Android! On May 18th of last year, I announced the alpha version of QKSMS. The response was amazing, and the community grew to about 20k users before the full launch of the app, and since then there’s been well over 100000 downloads. They app impressed some people enough to give me a real job as an Android dev, and everything since then has gone incredibly well. I’m not sure me or the app would be where we are today without the help of reddit, which is pretty crazy when I think about it
To thank you all, we’re giving away 5000 copies of QKSMS+ for free. It’s easy! Here’s how you do it:
Download QKSMS (Link here), make sure you’re on version 1.7
Visit qklabs.com/qksms-promo, and copy one of the codes that show up
Go to Settings -> View all settings -> QKSMS+ -> Redeem code
Enter your code, and submit it. The codes are case-sensitive, so keep that in mind
You now have QKSMS+!
When you're activating your code, you'll need to be quick! Everyone sees the exact same 5 codes on the site, and when one is used, you can see it get deactivated removed from the list while a new one pops in :) It's actually really fun to watch and see codes being activated in real-time, I'm glad it's working so well!
The app has come an incredibly long way since the last time I posted about it here, here's just a couple of the important changes
Much better MMS support
More material design + animations
Better MMS UI
In-app MMS feedback reporting (if the app can't find your APNs, use this and we get back to you directly with the settings you should use, while putting them in the app for the next update)
Better settings UX
Automatic emoji replacement (like facebook messenger)
Stability/performance improvements
Full Android Wear support
*not important but pretty damn cool - You can change the app icon on your homescreen to match your theme
As a little PSA, we have a new tester community! This one doesn't require permission to join, and the posts are public so anyone can jump in and give feedback. You can sign up for the beta builds on this page
Usually when I post on here there's a massive wall of text, I won't make you guys go through that again haha. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to AMA! In the spirit of the rest of my posts, I'll get back to everyone
Edit: We're getting the ol' reddit hug of death on our Firebase server, I'm upgrading the plan now. Will keep you guys updated
Edit 2: I've upgraded the plan. The site should be working fine now
Edit 3: Holy crap you guys.. we didn't expect such a huge response. Looking at the promo code site, they're disappearing so fast it's insane. We're gonna modify the site right now to show 8 codes rather than 5 at a time so they're a bit easier to grab
Edit 4: Its getting even harder to activate, so we now show 12 codes at a time. I haven't been responding for the last 30 mins or so - I'll be back soon
Edit 5: We had no idea so many of you guys wanted this. The codes are all gone already. We don't want the fun to be over yet though... We're adding another 5000 codes! Give us a few minutes to get them ready
Edit 6: The final edit (probably). The last code was just used, so we're now all out. This whole thing was absolutely incredible, I didn't expect such a big response from the community, but I'm happy that everything went as smoothly as it did. Thank you all so much for the incredible support you've shown. If there's anyone who asked a question and I missed them, feel free to ping me again. I got home about 2 hours ago and have responded to 1-200 messages since then, and it's 4am now, so as you can imagine, some may have slipped through the cracks haha. Going to get some sleep now, will get back to any new comments in the morning. Good night reddit!</p>
