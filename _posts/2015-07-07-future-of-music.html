    <strong>Most major music sites are betting big on the all-inclusive streaming model. </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Artists hate it. They feel they're being payed pennies on the dollar for their music. But it seems to be what listeners want, and labels have capitulated
    to streaming companies like Spotify, Apple, and Google. But maybe it's not the only way?
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Perhaps, in addition to these services, artists will in the future offer their own monthly streaming services</strong>
    , with special benefits that appeal to their most loyal followers. Maybe musicians can make music profitable and personal again.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>It's no longer a "maybe".</strong>
    Harvard grad and grammy-nominated musician Ryan Leslie recently launched an experiment in these ideas, and by doing so he may have just saved the music
    business from its steady decline.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Leslie's new club, mzrt.life, is a streaming service dedicated to solely his music.</strong>
    For $1 a month, he gives fans access to one new song per month. It's an ever-growing album which Leslie intends to keep going indefinitely, outwardly
    claiming to last a few hundred months/songs.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>For higher subscription fees, fans can message with Ryan</strong>
    . For even higher fees, fans can get autographs, call him in his studio while he's recording, fly privately with Leslie to his concerts, and sit in VIP
    seats.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>It's an experiment in varying levels of engagement,</strong>
    allowing fans to engage as much, or as little, as they want. Leslie is currently offering plans for $1, 5, 10, 25, 100, and 1000 per month.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>This model is never going to be the major revenue generator for artists.</strong>
    It's not going to replace streaming altogether. But this is a clever way to give avid fans a bit more than just an album to listen to, and to guarantee
    some consistent recurring revenue for artists in the process.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>For ages, Spotify has claimed one of its core benefits to artists to be "promotion" and "discovery"</strong>
    , but until now, this promotion didn't often lead to tangible benefits â€“ album sales, ticket sales, merchandise.
</p>
<p>
    This will work especially well for indie bands with small, but loyal followings.

<p>
    <strong>Mzrt is clearly just an experiment. </strong>
    Leslie is running this off of a simple website powered by payment-platform Gumroad. Still, Leslie might have just stumbled upon a model with huge
    potential.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Would you pay one of your favorite artists for more access, and monthly music?</strong>
