<h3>It's hard to deny the beauty of a unibody aluminum Macbook.</h3>
<p>It's sleek, premium, but not really personal. There are millions just like it, and in the coffee shop, you are just another guy (or gal) with a glowing Apple on his laptop.</p>
<p>This week I discovered a company that customized Macbook Pro's in a new, <strong>stunningly beautiful, but extremely expensive way.</strong></p>
<p>The company I'm talking about, <a href="http://www.uncovermac.com/?ref=Geeky">Uncover</a>, laser-cuts Macbooks to your specifications, creating glowing original logos and artwork on the cover of your laptop. Uncover can even add color to the translucent, glowing artwork of your choice.</p>

<h2><strong>How does it work?</strong></h2>
<p>Well, Uncover founder Victor Vandoorn <a href="http://www.producthunt.com/tech/uncover-2">took to Product Hunt</a>&nbsp;to describe his creation. "The inspiration came when I noticed that, when you turn down the brightness on a Mac screen, the backlit Apple logo also becomes dimmer.</p>
<p> Previously, I always thought that it was lit by a special LED, but actually, it's the screen's backlight. That meant there was a massive lightsource behind the aluminium, waiting to be 'uncovered'".</p>
<p><strong>Thirty prototypes later,</strong> Vandoorn and his team had developed a method for cutting glowing custom artwork into a Macbook's body.</p>
<p><strong>It's a three step process: </strong>the laptop owner collaborates with Vandoorn's designers to come up with a design. The Uncover team then creates a transulcent plexiglass-and-aluminum inlay. Lastly, they remove the screen from the Macbook, laser-cut design elements into the Macbook, insert the inlay, and reassemble the computer.</p>
<p><strong>Among his customers,</strong> Vandoorn claims to have customized Macbooks for "the CEO's of Evernote, Snapchat, Flipboard, Lyft, [and] The Next Web" as well as various DJs.</p>

<p><strong>As beautiful as Uncover's work is, I doubt you or I will be sending in our laptops anytime soon, </strong>unless you sleep in a bathtub of cash. The cutting process will cost you at least 399 euros, approximately $450. Users have to send their laptops into Uncover's studio in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The process itself takes four days, but you'll be without your laptop for at least a week. </p>
<p><strong>The process also voids your warranty with Apple. </strong>Uncover offers a free 6-month warranty on your screen, but other than that, you're on your own for the life of your laptop.</p>
<p><strong>Still, for those who can afford it,</strong> Uncover's process, paired with its software (which makes your logo "pulse") is the ultimate way to customize a Macbook.</p>
