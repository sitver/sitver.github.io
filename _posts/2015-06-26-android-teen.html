<h3>What were you doing when you were 18?</h3>

<p>I bet you didn&rsquo;t drop out of college, build two companies, and launch an app with 200,000 users and rave reviews. Unless, of course, you&rsquo;re today&rsquo;s Geeky guest.</p>

<p>Moez Bhatti, did just that, and he&rsquo;s already onto his next big idea, which has 10,000 beta users.</p>

<p>In this interview, we explore the secrets to his success, and his plans for the future.</p>

<p><b>Michael: When and why did you decide to build <a href = "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.moez.QKSMS&hl=en">QKSMS?</a></b></p>

<p><b>Moez:</b> I started working on it near the end of grade 11, so about two years ago It was about 2 months after I started learning android development.</p>

<p>At first it wasn&rsquo;t going to be a full-features SMS app, it was just going to be a simple &ldquo;quick-reply&rdquo; window that you could use with any app. I wanted to do that because I thought it would be pretty easy, and because it was something that I actually wanted to use because all of the other quick-reply features in the big SMS apps were either too ugly, too slow, or part of an app with too much bloat. I wanted something that I could customize, and use with any SMS app.</p>

<p>I worked on it on and off for about 4&ndash;5 months, and then just before I was ready to release it, Google announced 4.4 Kitkat with new SMS APIs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b>The major problem with this was the concept of a &ldquo;Default SMS app&rdquo;</b>, which meant that if your app sent SMS, it&rsquo;s the only app on the user&rsquo;s phone that can send SMS. This wouldn&rsquo;t work for me, because the user would *only* be able to reply to messages using my app. They couldn&rsquo;t compose new ones, browse their SMS threads, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="call-out" >

</div>
<p>At this point I had to decide if I was going to scrap the project, or go all out and make a full SMS app. And that&rsquo;s what I picked.</p>

<p>I worked on QKSMS on and off for about 8 months and used it as a project to help me learn android development in my free time. Then, about a year ago I launched the alpha. That ran for a few months, and then in November I released the public version.</p>

<p><b>Michael: Is this the first app you&rsquo;ve ever released?</b></p>

<p><b>Moez: </b>Yes it is.</p>

<p><b>Michael: 200,000 downloads in six months is really impressive. What have you done to market your app?</b></p>

<p><b>Moez:</b> I haven&rsquo;t done any paid marketing, so it&rsquo;s mostly just organic growth. I stay active with my users on reddit, and every few months I make a post talking about the progress, letting people know what&rsquo;s new, et cetera. Last month I did a giveaway where I gave out 10000 premium activation codes for QKSMS+, which got quite a bit of attention. I may explore some paid marketing options in the near future, like banner ads, but I&rsquo;m not really sure yet.</p>

<p><b>Michael: What did you do to kickstart your growth?</b></p>

<p><b>Moez:</b> I shared it to Reddit&rsquo;s R/Android and asked for feedback.</p>

<p>[In case you&rsquo;re curious -&gt; The text of that Reddit post, which received 200 upvotes and 210 comments]</p>

<p><b>Michael: Tell me a bit about your design process. Do you start your designs on paper, or go straight to prototyping/mocks?</b></p>

<p><b>Moez:</b> In the beginning I just started building things right away Nowadays I use Sketch to mock things up before building them Pen and paper was never very useful for me for UI work</p>

<p><b>Michael: Alright. What IDE (Integrated Development Environment) do you use?</b></p>

<p><b>Moez:</b> Android Studio, all the way. I&rsquo;m a huge advocate for AS over Eclipse.</p>

<p><b>Michael: What other tools do you use to develop this?</b></p>

<p><b>Moez:</b> Sketch (mockups), Photoshop (creating assets), Genymotion (testing multiple sizes). I also use Slicy for exporting assets&hellip; And git, if you count that (laughs).</p>

<p><b>Michael: Yeah. Git is life. That counts. Funny story actually. I run this blog through Github.</b></p>

<p><b>Moez:</b> Alright. Add it to the list.</p>

<p><b>Michael: What operating system do you develop on?</b></p>

<p><b>Moez:</b> OSX.</p>

<p><b>Michael: What&rsquo;s your setup like?</b></p>

<p>At work I&rsquo;ve got two 24&rdquo; 1080p IPS monitors running off a 13&rdquo; MBP (2015). At home I&rsquo;ve got two 28&rdquo; 4k monitors running off of my custom built desktop which is light-years ahead of this macbook.</p>

<p><b>Michael: Are you in college, or have you dropped out?</b></p>

<p><b>Moez:</b> Originally I left school to work for Enflick. I got the job at Enflick about 2 weeks after starting college, back in September of last year. I was working on <a href = "http://oneset.co">OneSet</a> and QKSMS on the side, but after about 6 months I realized that what I really want to do most is make something of my own.</p>

<p>Right now the majority of my time is spent working on OneSet, which is a fitness-based startup. It&rsquo;s a community where users can share workout ideas through 15 second videos, and photos with the next update.</p>

<p><b>Michael: What are your future plans for QKSMS?</b></p>

<p><b>Moez:</b> With QKSMS I&rsquo;m just constantly working on making it more stable, as that&rsquo;s the weak point right now. That, and MMS. Hopefully within the next few months I can develop those to the point where they&rsquo;re not problems.</p>

<p><b>Michael: What feature has been most popular with your users? What makes QKSMS special?</b></p>

<p><b>Moez:</b> People love the theming It&rsquo;s by far the most beautiful SMS app, especially after the most recent update. I&rsquo;m a very UI-focused developer, so I make sure there&rsquo;s a lot of attention spent on little details that help make a delightful experience. Things like the level of customization, how everything looks so clean yet functional, subtle animations, etc.</p>

<p>So to sum it up into one word, the design is what makes it stand out most, in my opinion.</p>

<p><b>Michael: What&rsquo;s the best example of this attention to detail?</b></p>

<p><b>Moez:</b> The way that the theming is done. I&rsquo;ve never seen an app that does it as seamlessly as QKSMS.</p>

<p>For pretty much any other app you see, when you change the theme, it&rsquo;ll essentially reload the app using the new attributes. Some apps are pretty good at hiding it, but you&rsquo;ll still notice things like janky animations and stuff like that.</p>

<p>With QK I built a pretty cool system that allows me to dynamically theme the entire app seamlessly. Currently I&rsquo;m working on a feature that allows the user to pick from an RGB color picker with access to over 16 million colors. Because I&rsquo;m doing everything dynamically at runtime, it was so easy to implement that it only took about 20 minutes and while making it easier for me, it makes for a much nicer experience for the user because they can animate or change anything they want.</p>

<p><b>Michael: That&rsquo;s inventive. I understand you also sell a premium in-app purchase.</b></p>

<p><b>Moez: </b>Premium costs $1.99 US It gives you: 200 extra themes (this will increase to 16 million in the next update) Delayed messaging Per-contact notifications Automatic night mode Custom quick-responses for Android Wear Scheduled messaging (coming soon)</p>

<p><b>Michael: I know iOS is really restrictive with 3rd-party access to messaging. Is it even possible to port something like this to iOS?</b></p>

<p><b>Moez: </b>It&rsquo;s not possible, at least not for users on unjailbroken phones, and I don&rsquo;t think the market of rooted iOS users who want a 3rd-party SMS app is big enough for it to be worth doing.</p>

<p><b>Michael: Agreed. Tell me a bit more about OneSet. When did you start work on that?&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><b>Moez:</b> We started it back around August. A couple of my cousins were very involved in the online fitness world, and what they found was that there wasn&rsquo;t really a good place to consume fitness content on the go. Of course there&rsquo;s YouTube and Instagram, but each have their own problems. The videos you find on YouTube are generally too long, and you find yourself skipping through them just to find the important stuff. And with Instagram, it&rsquo;s far too cluttered. There&rsquo;s a major lack of organization, and there&rsquo;s tons of spam that you don&rsquo;t really care about.</p>

<p>&nbsp;OneSet solves both of those problems by keeping videos at 15 seconds or less, and all of the content is completely categorized by muscle group and fitness type.</p>

<p><b>Michael: Solving a problem you experience. The time-honored theory of entrepreneurship. How many users do you have?</b></p>

<p><b>Moez:</b> We launched the Android beta about 2 months ago, currently we have around 10,000 beta users We expect a major jump once our iOS version goes live though. We just submitted it for review last night!</p>

<p><b>Michael: It seems like Vine for fitness. Is that correct?</b></p>

<p><b>Moez:</b> That&rsquo;s our tagline!</p>

<p><b>Michael: It looks great. I almost created something in that category years ago. I was struggling to find golf-specific workouts, so I almost built an app where users could post short exercise videos categorized by sport.</b></p>

<p><b>Moez:</b> Eventually we may be adding more deep levels of customization like individual sports, but right now we&rsquo;re just keeping it nice and lean and seeing what the users are looking for.</p>

<p><b>Michael: What&rsquo;s your role in all of this?</b></p>

<p><b>Moez:</b> I&rsquo;m the designer, and the lead on the Android development side.</p>

<p><b>Michael: What tools are you using to gather user feedback and track engagement? What key metrics are you tracking?</b></p>

<p><b>Moez:</b> We&rsquo;ve got an option in the app that&rsquo;s very visible that allows people to email us with feedback.</p>

<p>We use Google and Flurry analytics. Some of the more important metrics we watch for are our daily active users, new users, screen views, video views, which categories people are clicking on, etc.</p>

<p>&hellip;And retention, one of the biggest ones and I forgot to mention it(laughs).</p>

<p><b>Michael: How often do people email you? Is it more complaints, compliments, or feature requests?</b></p>

<p><b>Moez:</b> We generally get a couple a day In the beginning we had some complaints about our video loading performance, but we&rsquo;ve done a lot of optimizations since then and more recently it&rsquo;s been mainly feature requests</p>
<div class="call-out" >
  {{ site.theme.header_text }}
</div>
<p><b>Michael: What features are users asking for?</b></p>

<p><b>Moez:</b> One of the biggest one was auto-playing videos, like on Vine We actually just released this a couple days ago though. Previously you had to tap the video to get it to load</p>

<p>Push notifications was another thing that we revamped recently, due to user requests Now they provide a lot more contextual actions, so they&rsquo;d take you to the user or video or whatever is the relevant place to go, rather than just opening up the notifications page.</p>

<p><b>Michael: Are you running this off of Amazon Web Services?</b></p>

<p><b>Moez:</b> Yeah.</p>

<p><b>Michael: Serving video can get expensive. Are you bootstrapping this yourself.</b></p>

<p><b>Moez:</b> We are for now, but we&rsquo;re in negotiations with investors.</p>

<p><b>Michael: So what&rsquo;s the ultimate dream?</b></p>

<p><b>Moez:</b> Just to get it to a point where it&rsquo;s as big as it can possibly be, and people love it.</p>

<p><b>Michael: I love the passion. Thanks for your time.</b></p>

<p><b>Moez: </b>No problem.</p>
