#### Netflix is testing in-video advertising in a few select regions, with plans to subject all users to advertising. Let's [say no](https://www.change.org/p/netflix-say-no-to-commercials), before it's too late.

**I admit it. Testing. I watch too much Netflix.** My Law-And-Order addiction is not an efficient use of my time, but at least I enjoy it. Video ads waste time, without providing any pleasure. They're clutter, and they're the exact thing I'm trying to avoid as a Netflix subscriber, and I'm confident that many others feel the same way.

We're not paying Netflix for the privilege of watching TV. Plenty of places online offer similar content. We're paying for ad-free, hassle-free TV and movies.

That's why Geeky is launching [a petition on Change.org](https://www.change.org/p/netflix-say-no-to-commercials) telling Netflix that we won't tolerate in-video advertising. If you don't want to waste hours of your life watching ads for diapers, shampoo, and the next 50-Shades-Of-Grey movie, you better **[sign here](https://www.change.org/p/netflix-say-no-to-commercials) and [sign up here](https://sitver.typeform.com/to/qYoZrT)**

### Why Are Ads A Big Deal

**Think of it this way:** Let's say that Netflix adds in a modest two minutes worth of ads on every video. If you binge-watched every episode of Law And Order, you would be subjected to more than 15 hours of advertising.

Put another way, if you watch three episodes on Netflix per day, you would lose 36.5 hours of your life, a day and a half, every year to Netflix commercials. Don't let that happen.
