<p class="p1"><b>Apple wants you to store your startup web-app&#39;s (yes web app) data with iCloud, </b>and they&#39;re giving you a petabyte of free storage to do so. (For those scoring at home, a petabyte is 1 million gigabytes).</p>

<p class="p1">According to a calculator available on Apple&#39;s website, that petabyte should be enough for about 10 million free users.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>Cloudkit.js also comes with a dashboard</b> for watching and managing usage, including total users, active users, and database storage.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>The interface is very reminiscent of Parse,</b> a similar developer service bought a few years ago by Facebook to strengthen its own developer eco-system.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>It&#39;s a really unprecedented move, but one that makes sense for Apple in this competitive landscape.</b> Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook have been courting startups to their own ecosystems with large discounts, so that they can keep a close eye on hot startups, and buy them when the time is right. Companies like Netflix use Amazon&#39;s Amazon Web Services, and companies like Snapchat use Google&#39;s Cloud code.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>This massive offering is sure to give Apple a</b> chance at luring some of these startups to its own eco-system, and build relationships. These relationships give them the edge in partnerships and acquisitions, and also help to keep the best developers developing for iOS first.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>Cloudkit.js is available to everyone, now. <a href = "https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/DataManagement/Conceptual/CloutKitWebServicesReference/Introduction/Introduction.html">Check it out here.</a></b></p>
