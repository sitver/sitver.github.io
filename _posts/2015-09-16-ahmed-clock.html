    You’ve probably heard the story of Ahmed Mohamed, who was arrested for essentially “building while muslim”. Your first reaction was probably a mix of anger
    and disgust. So was mine. You probably thought “How could this happen in 2015?”. So did I.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    But are you glad Ahmed was arrested? I am. I’d like to go on the record: I’m glad Ahmed was arrested. And here’s why:
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    In every era, millions of people face some form of injustice, many repeatedly, but very few have the brains or the resources to turn that injustice into
    change. Off the top of my head, some of the few I can name are Rosa Parks, Nelson Mandela, Malala Yousafzai, and now Ahmed Mohamed. All four faced enormous
    hardships, but I’m confident that each would gladly face that same pain again, knowing the impact they’d had.

    Ahmed’s arrest was a terrible injustice, but it was also a good thing, because the discussion that’s emerging from it might prevent 100 future Ahmeds from
    having to see the inside of a jail cell. Ahmed’s family did an excellent job at publicizing the injustice, and publicity is a valuable thing. That
    publicity might lead to us praising the next 100 Ahmeds, rather than taking them away in handcuffs. That publicity might lead to students who are inspired,
    rather than suppressed, and who go on to create grand new devices, start companies, and make a difference.

    His story has led to invites from President Obama and Mark Zuckerberg, among others, and perhaps most importantly, his story has led to a big national
    conversation. His arrest will never hurt his job or happiness prospects. Thanks to this incident, he can probably go to any engineering college he pleases
    (not that he needed the help). His brilliance, paired with a hell of story, would be irresistible to any admissions committee. But now, thanks to his
    slight sacrifice, many tinkerers like him might be spared hardship, and perhaps supported.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    Thanks to Ahmed, the people who harmed him, from his teachers and administrators, to the police officers who aggressively interrogated him, will face the
    fury of the courts and the media. Ahmed’s town has a history of racism and Islamophobia, so perhaps the increased media attention might also lead to some
    local soul-searching, and a more welcoming, inclusive climate there.
</p>
<p dir="ltr">
    And the next time that any school administrators are facing a similar circumstance, perhaps they’ll remember Ahmed’s story, and practice more discretion.
    Perhaps they’ll take their own biases into account, and be kind, rather than cruel. Perhaps they’ll recognize a clock as a clock, and a brilliant boy as a
    brilliant boy.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
    I’ll reiterate, I’m glad Ahmed was arrested, but I'd wager he’s glad too, because the long-term positive impact that his arrest has should be well
    worth the short-term discomfort.
