<h3>Bugs suck, but they&#39;re inevitable in any complex application.</h3>
<p>Sometimes you need a good scapegoat though. Someone to blame, to let out your frustration on. </p>
<p><strong>Medium, the blogging platform founded by Ev Williams, is placing the blame for its latest buggy iOS update on an ex-employee named &quot;Peter&quot;.</strong></p>
<p>These are the release notes for Medium&#39;s latest update, released yesterday:

<h2> Does Peter Exist?</h2>
<p><strong>We haven&#39;t confirmed that &quot;Peter&quot; actually exists, but we certainly hope not.</strong></p>
<p><strong> He wouldn&#39;t be the first employee imagined by a startup to absorb blame. </strong>Groupon famously created a game called &quot;Punish Derrick&quot; that greeted anyone trying to unsubscribe from Groupon.</p>
<p> In the game, users could punish fictional employee Derrick, played by Groupon founder and CEO Andrew Mason.</p>

<h2> The Fail Whale </h2>

<p>Twitter users saw the so-called <a href="http://cdn1.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/11/twitter_fail_whale1.png">&quot;Fail Whale&quot;</a> many times after Twitter&#39;s launch, as the startup struggled to scale. As you might remember, Ev Williams was also a co-founder of Twitter.</p>
<p><strong>In the mean-time, Medium users are already reacting loudly to Peter&#39;s firing.</strong></p>
<p>In the app&#39;s reviews, one customer wrote <strong>&quot;Firing Peter is not a solution</strong>&quot;.</p>
<p> He/she continued &quot;I normally never write reviews, but this time I&#39;ve had enough. Up until the last update, everything was fine.</p>
<p> Then, Peter changed everything. The app crashes anytime I try to read an article. As if the app has become its own antagonist, all thanks to Peter. Just so you know, I use 4S&quot;.</p>
<p>Another customer rated the app two stars, with the headline &quot;<strong>oh...poor Peter</strong>&quot;.</p>
