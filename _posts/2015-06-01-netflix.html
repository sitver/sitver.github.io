<h3>Netflix is testing in-video advertising in a few select regions, with plans to subject all users to advertising. Let's <a href = "https://www.change.org/p/netflix-say-no-to-commercials">say no</a>, before it's too late.</h3>

<p><b>I admit it. I watch too much Netflix.</b> My Law-And-Order addiction is not an efficient use of my time, but at least I enjoy it. Video ads waste time, without providing any pleasure. They're clutter, and they're the exact thing I'm trying to avoid as a Netflix subscriber, and I'm confident that many others feel the same way.</p>

<p>We're not paying Netflix for the privilege of watching TV. Plenty of places online offer similar content. We're paying for ad-free, hassle-free TV and movies.</p>

<p>That's why Geeky is launching <a href = "https://www.change.org/p/netflix-say-no-to-commercials">a petition on Change.org</a> telling Netflix that we won't tolerate in-video advertising. If you don't want to waste hours of your life watching ads for diapers, shampoo, and the next 50-Shades-Of-Grey movie, you better <b><a href = "https://www.change.org/p/netflix-say-no-to-commercials">sign here</a> and <a href = "https://sitver.typeform.com/to/qYoZrT"> sign up here</a></b></p>

<h2> Why Are Ads A Big Deal </h2>
<p><b>Think of it this way:</b> Let's say that Netflix adds in a modest two minutes worth of ads on every video. If you binge-watched every episode of Law And Order, you would be subjected to more than 15 hours of advertising.</p>

<p>Put another way, if you watch three episodes on Netflix per day, you would lose 36.5 hours of your life, a day and a half, every year to Netflix commercials. Don't let that happen.</p>
