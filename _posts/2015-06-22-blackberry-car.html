<p class="p1">Blackberry&#39;s days of smartphone dominance are long over, but surprisingly the company still has a few brilliant, valuable technologies in other verticals.</p>

<p class="p1">QNX Software Systems, a division of Blackberry acquired in 2010, builds high-tech car systems for auto manufacturers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p1"><b>To demonstrate its latest technology, the QNX team built an insane concept car based on the Maserati&nbsp;</b><span class="s1"><b> Quattroporte GTS</b></span><span class="s2"><b>.</b></span></p>

<p class="p2">The QNX team took the $150,000 car and retrofitted it with brand new discrete systems, video screens, and a beautiful user interface that perhaps puts even Tesla to shame.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>Among the many modifications, QNX replaced every mirror in the car</b> with an equivalent digital screen. The screens show live feeds from cameras mounted around the car, practically eliminating common blind spots.</p>

<p class="p2"><b>QNX&#39;s tricked-out car isn&#39;t commercially available (yet)</b>, but the QNX platform is the basis for many car entertainment and control systems, so many of the technologies seen here should soon be coming to a car near you.</p>
