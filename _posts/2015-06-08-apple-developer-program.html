<p class="p1"><b>Apple has combined its OSX, iOS, WatchOS, and Safari development programs into one.&nbsp; The change came ahead of Apple&#39;s Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC).</b></p>

<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p1"><b>Whereas previously iOS and OSX developers would only have access to beta software and SDKs for their respective OS (for $99 each)</b>, now developers have access to every Apple development tool, beta software, and resource, for one flat fee of $99 per year.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>Current members have already been upgraded</b> to the new program, and future members can new enroll into the new program.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p1"><b>This is a long-awaited and unsurprising change. </b>Apple uses the developer fee more as a barrier-to-entry than a source of revenue (Apple has nearly $200 billion in cash).</p>

<p class="p1">&nbsp;The new program reflects that $99 is enough to deter regular consumers, while allowing independent developers to develop cross-platform apps.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>The change is also in-line with Apple&#39;s goal to create a seamless platform</b>, with apps that work across all Apple devices. More information on the new program is available at Developer.apple.com.</p>
