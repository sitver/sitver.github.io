<p class="p1"><b>Today Apple has quietly combined its OSX, iOS, WatchOS, and Safari development programs into one.&nbsp; The change came ahead of Apple&#39;s Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC).</b></p>

<p class="p1"><b>Whereas previously iOS and OSX developers would only have access to beta software and SDKs for their respective OS (for $99 each)</b>, now developers have access to every Apple development tool, beta software, and resource, for one flat fee of $99 per year.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>Current members have already been upgraded</b> to the new program, and future members can new enroll into the new program.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p1"><b>This is a long-awaited and unsurprising change. </b>Apple uses the developer fee more as a barrier-to-entry than a source of revenue (Apple has nearly $200 billion in cash).</p>

<p class="p1">&nbsp;The new program reflects that $99 is enough to deter regular consumers, while allowing independent developers to develop cross-platform apps.</p>
<h2>UPDATE: Even Bigger News</h2>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;The bigger news is that, after eight years, Apple will finally allow anyone with an iCloud account to package and run iPhone apps from Xcode on their own devices. You no longer need the $99 developer account. This is a surprising feature, but very welcome, because it allows beginner developers to test their code without shelling out $100 per year.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>These changes are also in-line with Apple&#39;s goal to create a seamless platform</b>, with apps that work across all Apple devices. More information on the new program is available at Developer.apple.com.</p>
