Lots of sites are speculating on what’s to come in iOS 9, the upcoming iteration of Apple’s mobile operating system. But what are the odds of any of these features actually coming? 

**Place your bets now.** We did the research, and came up with an extensive list of features, and the odds of them coming to your phone (provided you use an iPhone).

## What to expect when you’re expecting (to use iOS 9)

- **A better Siri (Odds: 99%):** iOS 9 will include a big update to Siri, in order to catch up to Microsoft’s Cortana, and Google’s Google Now. Improvements include access to flight, parking, and traffic info, and a snazzy new paint job. 
- **Force-Touch (Odds: 45%):** iOS 9 might include support for Apple’s force-Touch, allowing users of the next generation of iPhone. This will be particularly useful for typing, but it will also make other navigational tasks, like scrolling and swiping easier. 
- **Battery-life / speed Improvements (Odds: 50%):** iOS 9 will likely include software enhancements to make iOS run faster, and more efficiently. 
- **A New, better keyboard (Odds: 65%):** A new, much-needed keyboard redesign is very likely on the way. New keyboard designs may include better key placement (and more keys), as well as new design to make your typing more accurate. The following is highly unlikely, but I would really love to see custom keyboard sounds, because the current clicking sound drives me nuts (but silence while typing is worse). 
- **Night Mode (25%):** Using smartphones at night can be annoying. iPhones already have ambient light sensors to automatically adjust to the dark, but Apple may release an entire “night mode” to make using your phone in the dark a joy. 
- **Facetime Group Calls (50%):** Apple’s popular iChat could handle several people video-chatting at once. Its replacement, facetime, can’t. Expect that to change in iOS 9, with support for up to four simultaneous chatters. 
- **iMessage improvements (Odds: 80%):** Very minor iMessage updates are on the way. Improved group chats and improved facetime stability. 
- **Beats-Music (Odds: 70%):** Apple wants in on the music-streaming business, and it plans to enter with an ad-free music-streaming service on iOS 9, similar to the Beats Music service that it acquired when it purchased Beats last year for $3 billion. The new service will likely offer extremely low pricing, in order to compete with Spotify (which has nearly 50 million users). 
- **Better Maps (Odds: 60%):** Apple has acquired several notable maps startups lately, in a quest to improve Apple Maps and better compete with Google Maps. Well, we will probably see at least some of the fruits of that effort in iOS 9. 
- **Home (Odds: 45%):** Apple’s HomeKit framework is finally on the way, offering easy home automation, and with it comes a shiny new app called “Home”. Home will be the central location for managing your smart devices. You’ll be able to do things like lock the door, turn the heat up, or check that you turned the stove off, all from one app. 

## Expected Release Schedule:
- **June:** iOS 9 will first be unveiled at Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) in early June. Developers will have access to the beta OS in early June, and regular folks will have access by September. 
- **July:** Apple make offer a consumer beta-testing option, allowing non-developers to try the iOS beta (legally) for the first time. Apple did the same for Mac OSX earlier this year. 
- August-September: The new lineup of iPhones should arrive between late August and early September.  
- The iPhone 6S and 6S+ will likely feature the same design and display as their predecessors, but they will likely have an internal upgrade (processor and RAM) plus a better camera. Some sources indicate they may also have force-touch technology, providing feedback to users as they swipe and type. 
- We’ll also see the return of the popular iPhone 5C as the iPhone 6C. It will resemble the original 5C, with its candy lacquer, but it will feature touch-id (the fingerprint scanner), and NFC (the wireless technology that allows ApplePay to work).
