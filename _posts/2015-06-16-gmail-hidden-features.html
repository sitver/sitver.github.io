<p class="p1"><b>For as long as Gmail has existed, I have had multiple Gmail accounts</b>. It helps me categorize, and compartmentalize my emails, and it allows me to sign up for multiple accounts for everything from Amazon, to Paypal.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>Today I learned </b>about two incredible, hidden Gmail features which make having multiple accounts completely unnecessary.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>You&#39;re going to love these,</b> and when you do, I hope you&#39;ll consider signing up for our Geeky digest of interesting stories, tips, and reviews.</p>

<p class="p1"><h2>Feature #1: Dots.</h2></p>

<p class="p1">Let&#39;s say you register Johndoe@gmail.com. But then, you realize that you&#39;d rather have a dot in your email (john.doe@gmail.com, or j.ohndoe@gmail.com).</p>

<p class="p1">You can add a dot anywhere in your Gmail address, or even multiple dots, and it will automatically be sent to your address.</p>

<p class="p1">You can, for example, use Johndoe@gmail.com and j.o.h.n.d.o.e@gmail.com interchangeably, without having to set up a new email.</p>
<script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<!-- In-post ad -->
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-0173928743945696"
     data-ad-slot="3706338289"
     data-ad-format="auto"></ins>
<script>
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>

<p class="p1">This feature was designed to prevent the inevitable bounced email, when someone puts a dot where there should be none (i.e john.doe instead of johndoe), but it can also be a nifty lifehack.</p>

<p class="p1">You can give different emails to different people, and filter emails into separate folders based on which address they use.</p>

<p class="p1">You can easily separate emails from friends, co-workers, or family, keeping business and pleasure separate.</p>

<p class="p1">You can use this to register for multiple accounts on your favorite site. I&#39;m sure there are many other clever uses, but I&#39;ll leave it at those, so that I can reveal to you the second, unheralded hero of a feature.</p>

<p class="p1"><h2>Feature #2: Plusses.</h2></p>

<p class="p1"><b>Yes. Plusses (+).</b> Plusses work like dots, in that they allow you to make unlimited shadow emails that all forward to your Gmail account.</p>

<p class="p1">John, from the last example, can register for banks using johndoe+banking@gmail.com, and Geeky&#39;s digest using johndoe+geeky@gmail.com.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>He can use this to create unlimited email addresses, instantly. No setup required.</b></p>

<p class="p1">You can even use this to your advantage when emailing other Gmail accounts. Want to remind someone that they owe you money? <b>Email them with a message added to their address, like &quot;JohnDoe+GiveMeMyMoney@gmail.com&quot;.</b></p>

<p class="p1">You can give out different addresses to different contacts. You can add in slogans (johndoe+isthebestplumber@gmail.com). You can do so many interesting things with this that I haven&#39;t even thought of.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>One of my favorite uses:</b> give different websites different email addresses, so that if one site is hacked, you don&#39;t need to throw out your email account to stop the spam. Simply block incoming emails to that particular address.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>You can also use this feature for creating multiple accounts on websites like Facebook and Twitter.</b></p>

<p class="p1">These two features are really nifty, and I recommend making use of them.</p>

<p class="p1">(note: These features are not available on other providers, like Yahoo)</p>

<p class="p1"><b>And if you have any questions, email michael.sitver+questions@gmail.com ;)</b></p>
