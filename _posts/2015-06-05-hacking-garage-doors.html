title: Intruders Can Open Your Garage In 9 Seconds, Using A Toy
---
<p>Garage doors aren't secure. That's not new. What is new is that using an old toy, an intruder can open your garage door in under 10 seconds.</p> <p><h3>Why? How? I'll tell you.</h3></p>

  <p>If you're like many Americans, you use a fixed-code garage door. On these doors, a certain radio frequency unlocks and opens the door, allowing whoever created the frequency access to your house.</p>

  <p><b>The problem is, the number of frequencies available is very limited.</b> There are only 4096 possible codes/frequencies to unlock these garage doors. To put that in perspective, a 2-character alphanumeric password (i.e "Hi", "12") has 5184 possible combinations.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;<b>Even worse,</b> the way these openers work makes it easy for an intruder to try multiple codes in quick succession, making it easy for a high-tech intruder to brute-force hack their way into your garage. There's no rate-limiting. Intruders can try as many frequencies as they'd like, in as little time as they'd like.</p>
  <p><b>Hacker/Blogger Samy Kamkar was able to modify a children's toy,</b> normally used to send text messages, into a device that sends out frequencies one at a time, to open garages. The device was already fully capable of transmitting the frequencies. Kamkar simply had to program the device to send the frequencies in the right order.</p> <p><b>Even scarier, Kamkar found a flaw that allows his device to open doors without having to guess every combination.&nbsp;</b></p> <p>The way that garage-door openers read and verify the codes they receive, if for example "030405" was sent, the opener searches for the access code by shaving off one digit at a time. For example, it would try "030", and then "304", rather than shaving off three digits at a time, and going to "405".</p> <p><b>Using the work of Dutch mathematician De Bruijn</b>, who discovered a sequence of numbers that cover every possible combination for a series of digits, Kamkar was able to try all 4096 combinations in 4107 bits, just 4.2% of the code required to guess combinations the traditional brute-force way. This allows his device to open any garage door of this type in under 10 seconds.</p> <p><b>This is a remarkable security flaw,</b> and one that many potential victims aren't aware of. You're aware now, so spread the word, and make sure you yourself are protected.</p><p>
