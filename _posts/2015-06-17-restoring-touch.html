<h3 class="p1">We&#39;re one step closer to Terminator...</h3>
<p class="p1"><b>For the first time, paralyzed patients can &quot;feel&quot; things they touch with their brain-controlled robotic arm.</b> Scientists at The University of Chicago have developed a brain implant that turns sensor data from robotic arms into &quot;feeling&quot; in the brain, by using electricity to stimulate the somatosensory cortex of the brain.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p1">After years of research and testing, a month ago a tetraplegic patient received the first of these touch-restoring implants.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>Touch is not the first sense to be restored by the ever-growing field of&nbsp; &quot;neuro-prosthetics&quot;</b>, electronic devices that not only mimic human functions, but interface with the body:</p>

<p class="p1"><b>Cochlear implants,</b> which work by recording sound, converting it into electric signals, and passing it on to the auditory nerve, have restored hearing to 300,000 patients since their introduction. <b>Visual neuro-prosthetics</b> in trial stages are starting to restore functional sight to blind patients.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p1"><b>But this discovery is so much bigger...</b></p>

<p class="p1">Right now, anyone who is tetraplegic requires constant care. They cannot walk, or grab things, or dress themselves. This places a huge burden of cost and time on their families, and places a huge psychological burden, guilt, on those who suffer from this.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>Neuro-prosthetic arms allow these patients to do some things for themselves, and may eventually allow them to live independently.&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class="p1"><b>Why is the sensation touch so important?</b> Without the sensation of touch , artificial limbs have been very difficult to control. Studies show that even basic tasks like lighting a match can be very difficult, if the thumb and forefinger are numbed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p1">That&#39;s why this advancement is so huge. With the sensation of touch, patients may one day be able to complete difficult, pressure-sensitive tasks such as painting, or gripping an egg.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>It took a lot of time and effort, even after finding the technology to be feasible, to get to this point. </b>Scientists had to find the electrical signals that mimicked the sensation of touch. They had to find a way to map pressure sensors to electrical signals, and convert any level of pressure into a feeling, and they needed to make sure it was safe.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p1">The question is no longer whether it&#39;s feasible. The question is how far this technology can go. Dr. Sliman Bensmaia, one of the lead researchers on this project for The University of Chicago, believes that <b>one day robotic arms could surpass the human arm in terms of strength, responsiveness,&nbsp; and speed.</b></p>

<p class="p1">But that&#39;s down the road. For now, we&#39;ll just have to settle for restoring autonomy to the lives of a few paraplegic folks. That&#39;s pretty good.</p>
