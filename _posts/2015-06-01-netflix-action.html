Let&#39;s <a href="https://www.change.org/p/netflix-say-no-to-commercials">say no</a>, before it&#39;s too late.</h4>

<p><strong>I admit it. Testing. I watch too much Netflix.</strong> My Law-And-Order addiction is not an efficient use of my time, but at least I enjoy it. Video ads waste time, without providing any pleasure. They&#39;re clutter, and they&#39;re the exact thing I&#39;m trying to avoid as a Netflix subscriber, and I&#39;m confident that many others feel the same way.</p>
<p>We&#39;re not paying Netflix for the privilege of watching TV. Plenty of places online offer similar content. We&#39;re paying for ad-free, hassle-free TV and movies.</p>
<p>That&#39;s why Geeky is launching <a href="https://www.change.org/p/netflix-say-no-to-commercials">a petition on Change.org</a> telling Netflix that we won&#39;t tolerate in-video advertising. If you don&#39;t want to waste hours of your life watching ads for diapers, shampoo, and the next 50-Shades-Of-Grey movie, you better <strong><a href="https://www.change.org/p/netflix-say-no-to-commercials">sign here</a> and <a href="https://sitver.typeform.com/to/qYoZrT">sign up here</a></strong></p>
<h3 id="why-are-ads-a-big-deal">Why Are Ads A Big Deal</h3>
<p><strong>Think of it this way:</strong> Let&#39;s say that Netflix adds in a modest two minutes worth of ads on every video. If you binge-watched every episode of Law And Order, you would be subjected to more than 15 hours of advertising.</p>
<p>Put another way, if you watch three episodes on Netflix per day, you would lose 36.5 hours of your life, a day and a half, every year to Netflix commercials. Don&#39;t let that happen.</p>
