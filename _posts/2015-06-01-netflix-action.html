	We&rsquo;ve seen shower-head speakers. We&rsquo;ve seen  <a href = "http://www.amazon.com/oc/echo/ref_=ods_dp_ae">creepy, autonomous speakers </a> that look like trash cans. But we&rsquo;ve never seen anything quite like this latest speaker,&nbsp;<b>the sound torch.</b></div>

	<b>This speaker is hot&hellip;literally.</b>&nbsp;The Sound Torch is a portable bluetooth speaker with built-in pyrotechnics. Just hook up your music via bluetooth, and the sound torch automatically syncs to it, creating fiery patterns to match your fiery tunes.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<b>The flames will jump as the base drops, sway to the chorus, or shoot and up and down to the beat</b>, based on the settings you choose in the accompanying mobile app. You can create your own patterns, or use the pre-made patterns they provide.</div>

	The sound torch&rsquo;s flames are powered by lighter fluid, and its tunes are powered by a 12-hour battery. It&rsquo;s all being produced and sold by a dutch startup of the same name.&nbsp;</div>
<div>

<div>
	<b>The Sound Torch isn&rsquo;t yet available to the average joe.</b>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s currently seeking funding on Kickstarter, to help start production. A previous attempt at crowdfunding failed earlier this year, but it looks like the sound torch may become a reality.&nbsp;</div>

	So far they&rsquo;ve raised 73% of their $30,000 goal, but according to Kickstarter-prediction site Kicktraq, they&rsquo;re on pace to raise about 150% of their goal by the time their campaign closes in 16 days.</div>

	<b>If you&rsquo;d like your own Sound Torch, you can currently pre-order one <a href = "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/markusbuchnorgaard/the-sound-torch-set-your-music-on-fire?ref=category">for around $160</a></b>&nbsp;on Kickstarter today. Assuming that the company can truly produce a safe, functional product, they expect to ship Kickstarter orders by December of next year.</div>
