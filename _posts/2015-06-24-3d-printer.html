<h3 class="p1"><b>3D Printing has so much potential, but right now it&#39;s so expensive, loud, and difficult-to-maintain...right? Wrong.</b></h3>

<p class="p1">Today, on the show-floor of New York&#39;s CE Week, I witnessed a printer that was quiet, affordable, and simple. It doesn&#39;t have the highest resolution prints. It doesn&#39;t print ABS plastic (it only printers PLA). But it works, and it works well, and my three year quest for a 3D printer is finally over.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>&nbsp;If you&#39;re looking for an entry-level 3D printer, this might be what you want.</b></p>

<p class="p1">The printer I witnessed was the New Matter MOD-t, a $399 FFF (fused-filament-fabricator) printer which produces very pleasant prints quietly, and simply.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>The New Matter device is unobtrusive.</b> It&#39;s about the size of a microwave, and far more beautiful. Prints are sent via Wifi, so the only visible wire is the power cord. The printer itself is a small, transparent box, with a smooth white base.&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<p class="p1"><b>The printer uses servo motors, rather than stepper motors</b>, and it flips the traditional model of a fused-filament-fabricator printer, by moving the print-bed forward/backward, and left/right, and the print head only up and down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p1">These changes make the MOD-t quiet, and really resistant to breaking or failing on a print. There&#39;s no bed-leveling, or print-head clogging. This printer just works.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p1">For the beginner-printer who doesn&#39;t want to spend more time maintaining their printer than printing, this is fantastic option.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>Of course, any printer has its drawbacks:</b> It&#39;s not customizable or upgradable, as open-source Rep-Rap printers are (the more common low-cost option). The maximum print volume is relatively small, at&nbsp; 6x4x5 inches (though there are many much smaller print-beds).</p>

<p class="p1">&nbsp;The MOD-t only prints PLA filament. It can&#39;t handle the more putrid ABS plastic. But as far as beginner models go, this is at the top of my list.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>The MOD-t starts at $399, takes standard 1.75 mm PLA filament, and has a 90-day warrantee.</b></p>

<p class="p1">(Editor&#39;s note: I&#39;m probably going to buy one of these myself. That is one of the highest marks I can give to a product I cover).</p>
