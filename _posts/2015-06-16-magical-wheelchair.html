<h3  ><span class="s1"><b>Paralysis shouldn&rsquo;t stop children from having an enjoyable halloween&hellip; </b>This is the message that parents Ryan and Lana Weimer have been spreading for the past few years to their three, wheel-chair-confined children, all of whom suffer from a rare form of muscular dystrophy called Spinal Muscular Atrophy.</span></h3>

<p  ><span class="s1"><b>Mr. Weimer has been hard at work</b> for the past few years, building costumes like this &ldquo;How To Train Your Dragon&rdquo;-themed wheelchair that allow his kids to have magical halloweens, despite their disability.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p  ><span class="s1">&nbsp;<b>Now, Ryan wants to spread the joy beyond his own family.</b> That&rsquo;s why he and his wife Lana launched an organization called &ldquo;Magic Wheelchair&rdquo;. According to Ryan, the organization&rsquo;s goal is to &ldquo;put a smile on the face of every child in a wheelchair&rdquo;.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p  ><span class="s1"><b>&nbsp;For obvious reasons, I&rsquo;m all for it</b>, which is why I wanted to raise awareness of a new Kickstarter campaign launched by the Weimer organization.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p  ><span class="s1"><b>&nbsp;They set out to raise $15,000, to build five intense costumes for five more wheelchair-confined kids.</b> With 16 days left in their campaign, the Weimers have already raised $17,450, on their way to providing another costumer (each costs about $3,000 to produce).</span></p>

<p  ><span class="s1"><b>I&rsquo;m calling on the internet </b>to give what they can, to make halloween magical for even more children. For each additional $3,000 they raise, the Weimers will be able to build another costume.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p  ><span class="s1">Even&nbsp; $15 (what I plan to give), multiplied by the power of the internet, can easily build a few more chairs.</span></p>
