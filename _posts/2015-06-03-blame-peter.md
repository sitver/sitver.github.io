###Bugs suck, but they're inevitable in any complex application.

Sometimes you need a good scapegoat though. Someone to blame, to let out your frustration on. 

**Medium, the blogging platform founded by Ev Williams, is placing the blame for its latest buggy iOS update on an ex-employee named "Peter".**

These are the release notes for Medium's latest update, released yesterday:

<a class="button shadowlight" style = "font-weight: bold; background: #55acee !important; background-color: #55acee !important; color: white !important; border-color:#55acee !important;text-align: center; background: #55acee; border: 1px solid #1ABC9C; color: #fff; text-decoration: none;" href="https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=msitver"> Follow Via Twitter</a>

[What's New:

-Peter let a couple nasty bugs slip into our last release, these have been fixed

-Fired Peter]

**We haven't confirmed that "Peter" actually exists, but we certainly hope not.**

** He wouldn't be the first employee imagined by a startup to absorb blame. **Groupon famously created a game called "Punish Derrick" that greeted anyone trying to unsubscribe from Groupon.

 In the game, users could punish fictional employee Derrick, played by Groupon founder and CEO Andrew Mason.

Twitter users saw the so-called ["Fail Whale"](http://cdn1.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/11/twitter_fail_whale1.png) many times after Twitter's launch, as the startup struggled to scale. As you might remember, Ev Williams was also a co-founder of Twitter.

**In the mean-time, Medium users are already reacting loudly to Peter's firing.**

In the app's reviews, one customer wrote **"Firing Peter is not a solution**".

 He/she continued "I normally never write reviews, but this time I've had enough. Up until the last update, everything was fine.

 Then, Peter changed everything. The app crashes anytime I try to read an article. As if the app has become its own antagonist, all thanks to Peter. Just so you know, I use 4S".

Another customer rated the app two stars, with the headline "**oh...poor Peter**".
