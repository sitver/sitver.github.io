<h4>When it comes to charging your iPhone on the go, there are a million and one different gizmos and doo-dads (official term) for sale to do it.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having tried about a million such devices myself (Ok. Slight exaggeration there), I&rsquo;ve found that there is no one best charger. It&rsquo;s entirely dependent on your needs, your budget, and your taste.</p>
<p>That being said, those looking for a solid, affordable dock-style charger with built-in juice, should be very pleased with the&nbsp;<strong>$30&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PSKMSGQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00PSKMSGQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=beautifulcamera-20&amp;linkId=F5ZWMONYSGQFGVIQ" data-href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PSKMSGQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00PSKMSGQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=beautifulcamera-20&amp;linkId=F5ZWMONYSGQFGVIQ"><strong>Ventev Chargedock 2000</strong></a>&nbsp;(the company claims this retails for $40, but I was able to find them for $30).</p>
<p>The Chargedock 2000 is, as the name implies, a charging dock &mdash; a device that serves as both a phone/iPod stand, and a charger &mdash;  with a 2000 miliAmp-hour battery.</p>
<h4>The design:</h4>
<center><img src = "/img/chargedock-open.jpg" href = "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text={{ page.title }}&url={{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}&via=msitver&related={{ site.twitter_username }}"></img></center>
<p>It&rsquo;s designed in the shape of a little couch cushion, and it&rsquo;s extremely portable. It&rsquo;s about twice as thick as an iphone, and about half as long. It&rsquo;s coated with a soft, rubberish plastic that adds a bit of durability to the dock, and makes it comfortable to tote in your pocket (the lack of sharp corners helps with that as well).</p>
<p>Flip the cover of the Chargedock open, and you&rsquo;ll find a single lightning connector, angled slightly like a picture frame, allowing iPhones, iPods, and iPads to rest comfortably on a rubber backstop. Docks like these act as kick-stands, allowing you to use your phone as it charges, without having to hold it.</p>
<p>On the back of the Chargedock are a micro-usb port and a single switch. The switch turns on and off the charger. The on/off state is indicated by a row of four little indicator lights. These lights also alert you to how much charge the battery holds.</p>

<h4>The Good:</h4>

<p>In my time using the Chargedock, I used it mostly while tethered to my laptop, on my desk. It works perfectly well as a regular charger, and it allows easy access to my phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I brought it on the go though, it really shined. It fit nicely into my pocket, my car, and my backpack, and provided me with the juice I needed to get through the day. The battery indicator was a nice touch, allowing me to keep tabs on when I needed a recharge.</p>
<p>At 1A of charge, this thing can zap a battery from red numbers (almost empty), to green numbers (reasonably full) in very short order.</p>
<p>I also appreciat that the included micro-usb cable was nice and long (about 1 meter). I absolutely hate when battery companies give you a foot-long cord to charge your devices, as if that&rsquo;s enough length. I know. I care too much about the little things.</p>
<h4><strong>The Bad:</strong></h4>
<p>Still, a charging dock like this isn&rsquo;t right for everyone. Since it&rsquo;s a pretty sizeable stand, you can&rsquo;t use it to charge your phone while in your pocket. You need to find a place (or at least a bag) to set your phone and the dock down in. You need space. If this is a problem for you, you might be better served by products like Mophie&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00THJZSUM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00THJZSUM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=appstochr-20&amp;linkId=FBRSXIUEEHSGH7NC" data-href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00THJZSUM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00THJZSUM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=appstochr-20&amp;linkId=FBRSXIUEEHSGH7NC">Juicepack charging cases</a>, or phonesuit&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DL46GOG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00DL46GOG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=appstochr-20&amp;linkId=6DJTGXCLQ5ZCZ3BE" data-href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DL46GOG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00DL46GOG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=appstochr-20&amp;linkId=6DJTGXCLQ5ZCZ3BE">Flex charger</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;2,000 miliamp hours also isn&rsquo;t a lot of extra juice for a device of this size. It will certainly help you out in a pinch, but it won&rsquo;t last you an entire camping trip, or a long day of travel, or charging for multiple devices. It will provide a bit more than one full charge for most modern iPhones.</p>
<p>I should also note that with my iPhone 5S I had some trouble fitting my phone on the dock with its case. With the case off, it was no problem, and with thinner cases, it wasn&rsquo;t a problem. I also had no trouble fitting my iPad Mini, with its case, onto the dock.</p>
<h4><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h4>
<p>For everyday power-users who run their phone batteries down quickly every day, the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PSKMSGQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00PSKMSGQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=beautifulcamera-20&amp;linkId=F5ZWMONYSGQFGVIQ" data-href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PSKMSGQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00PSKMSGQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=beautifulcamera-20&amp;linkId=F5ZWMONYSGQFGVIQ">Ventev Chargedock</a>&nbsp;is an excellent option for a little mid-day fill-up. Even as just a charging dock, the Chargedock is an excellent tool. But if you&rsquo;re looking for a charger with a lot of juice, or pocketability, you should look elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>&nbsp;Ventev gave me one of these at a trade show in New York, in hopes that I would review it. That in no way impacted my review of this charger, but I believe in transparency, so I thought it was worth mentioning.</p>
