<p class="p1">&nbsp;<b>Whenever you send a message on Facebook, your location, within a few feet, is recorded, and shared to your friends.</b>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b class="p1">What does that mean? By carrying on a conversation, someone could track you throughout your day. They could see that you were at Starbucks at 10 AM, or Chipotle at 12.</b></p>

<p class="p1">You can even map and cross-reference data. You can see that Jane and John have been at the same house, at the same time, frequently this week, and you can infer that they&#39;re hooking up. You can see that several of your friends are on a beach in Tahiti, and insinuate that they&#39;re taking some type of trip together. You can piece together relationships, and lives, without people knowing.</p>

<p class="p1">This is all made possible by Facebook's liberal APIs, which make accessing user data incredibly easy. It's no surprise that this data is collected, but it is surprising how easy it is to exploit, as shown by the technical essay linked at the bottom of this post. This has serious&nbsp; implications. Imagine someone is secretly struggling with a drug addiction, and their friends discover that they&#39;re seeking drug treatment. Imagine a snooping spouse discovering that their significant other has been at the same place, at the same time, with his receptionist, several nights in a row.</p>

<p><b class="p1">Facebook does allow you to turn this feature off, but they aren&#39;t nearly vocal enough about how much data they&#39;re collecting, and who has access to it. It&#39;s time for us to have an open conversation of what&#39;s OK to share automatically, and what is not.</b></p>
