<h3 ><b>Conventional smartphone cameras are getting better and better, but they can&#39;t see everything.&nbsp;</b></h3>

<p >They can&#39;t look through walls and pipes, find pets in the dark of night, measure temperatures, or see air leaking through a window crack. That&#39;s where thermal imaging devices (thermal cameras) come in...</p>

<p ><b>Today I tried out one of those cameras, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NYWAHHM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00NYWAHHM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=appstochr-20&amp;linkId=E6GPWEDJFQRVSAME">the Seek Thermal</a>.</b> Seek Thermal is a tiny $250 thermal camera that plugs into iOS and Android devices (you need to buy one with the correct plug for your device), and works with a free accompanying app.</p>

<h3 ><b>How Does It Work? What Can It Do?</b></h3>
<p ><b>Once plugged in,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SSZ5KPY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00SSZ5KPY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=appstochr-20&amp;linkId=ZFHONTOQWH5M4355"> the Seek</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NYWAHHM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00NYWAHHM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=appstochr-20&amp;linkId=E6GPWEDJFQRVSAME"> </a>captures data through 30,000 thermal pixels.</b> It&#39;s not high resolution, but Seek images are clear enough to give you a basic image, and show heat signatures. Out of the box, the Seek will show thermal images with blue representing cool items, and red representing heat. The Seek app allows you to adjust the sensitivity of the camera&#39;s processing by setting temperature ranges to show in color. Focussing the thermal camera is a manual, but simple process.</p>

<p ><b>One of the coolest things this technology can do is find living creatures in the dark.</b> Since mammals are warm-blooded, they produce heat signatures in the shape of their body, that is visible to this device. This means that you can use Seek, and devices like it to find lost pets at night, go hunting (for this, Seek recommends its higher-end model), or check for intruders. You can also use it to find hidden cracks in your windows that are allowing air in and out, and wasting energy, and to find problems with your plumbing, without having to dig into it. By setting a temperature range, you can even see which parts of the body are the hottest, and which are the coolest.</p>

<p >For those developers out there, Seek has not yet released an SDK, allowing you to make your own heat-mapping apps, but the company says it is on the way.</p>

<p >Seek also sells an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SSZ5KPY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00SSZ5KPY&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=appstochr-20&amp;linkId=ZFHONTOQWH5M4355">XR or &quot;extended range&quot;</a> model for $50 more.</p>

<h3 ><b>Do I need this?</b></h3>

<p >Probably not. I certainly don&#39;t, as cool as it is (pun intended). This is fantastic for hunters, repairmen, and the particularly security-conscious, but for most of us, it would simply be a cool, expensive toy.</p>

<h3 ><b>Do you recommend it?</b></h3>

<p >I cannot yet recommend the Seek, because I haven&#39;t had a chance to review it and put it through its paces (yet). I have used it (at a trade show), and it worked well, but that was in a very controlled environment.</p>
