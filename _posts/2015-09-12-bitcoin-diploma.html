    Fake degrees are really easy (and rather cheap) to obtain.
</h3>
<br/>
<h4 dir="ltr">
    A few hundred dollars can buy you a doctorate degree from Harvard, a law degree from Yale, or a masters in engineering from Stanford.

<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Thousands of so-called “Diploma Mills” are standing by to take your order, and right now, neither the government nor the universities can do anything about
    it. Some of these organizations rake in millions of dollars a year, and have gone as far as to create fake “Universities” that exist only online.

<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    These faux academic institutions may not have the name value of a real University, but when contacted, they’ll confirm you graduated, and that makes
    detecting fraudulent degrees all the more difficult. Ingeniously, many of them use name-hybrids of common universities (i.e Columbia Southern University)
    to create some form of false name recognition.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    It’s a real problem, because studies show millions of Americans are using these degrees, and we don’t have a system in place to catch the cheaters.
    Teachers and accountants and social workers are using fake degrees to get pay raises and jobs they aren’t qualified for.

    Imagine that! There are several fake doctors practicing in the United States. There are police officers with fake criminology degrees, and psychologists
    with fake psychology degrees. These are people who have managed to evade the entire multi-year process and training that we rely on to keep ourselves safe.
    And they’re putting you at risk.
</p>
<br/>
<h2 dir="ltr">
    Luckily, an 18-year old may have finally built the solution that will put “Diploma Mills” out of business.
</h2>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Meet Louison Dumont.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Dumont left his native France for Silicon Valley at the age of 17, with dreams of using cryptocurrency technology to revolutionize the way documents are
secured and authenticated. After months of work, he finally found a partner (and funding) in world-famous VC Tim Draper, and he started his company,    <a href="https://bitproof.io">Bitproof</a>.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    I was listening to a recent Freakonomics podcast when I first learned just how prevalent diploma fraud is. I was shocked. I spent some time imagining
    solutions, and I realized that the blockchain might work well for this, so I reached out to Louison to see if he’d thought about the problem.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    It turned out that he had, and that he was already partnering with a French university to launch the first unforgeable “secure digital diploma”. I had to
    learn more, so I probed him further.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Dumont and his team have “developed a very intuitive software for universities to let them issue digital diplomas in a secure environment (256 bits
    encryption and 2FA)”. Each graduate is given a paper diploma, and a Digital Diploma Number (DDN).
</p>
<br/>

<p dir="ltr">
    If this system spreads, job applicants will soon include DDNs on their resume. Using a simple blockchain search, employers can instantly verify the
    validity of a certificate and its issuer.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    According to Dumont, Bitproof uses “bank-grade encryption” and only schools with the proper cryptographic keys can issue digital diplomas.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
Dumont spun up a prototype of his digital diploma for me,    <a href="https://merkle.io/diploma/5b6768dd468f5d77acf946b1f1959cb5dc84704e463ae187a48490d2fd12dd7b">which you can see here</a>. As you can see, it
    verifies the diploma holder, major/degree-type, and institution, and it’s all stored on the blockchain, accessible but immutable for all.
</p>
<br/>

<p dir="ltr">
    In the future, Dumont hopes to see the technology used by mainstream universities, as well as online educational institutions like Edx and Coursera. To
    help it catch on, he plans to open-source the technology, allowing each institution to implement their own system.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Dumont demoed his technology for me, and it is indeed very well secured. Once it goes mainstream, it will be the fastest way to verify a diploma’s
    authenticity.

<h3>Remaining Challenges</h3>
<p dir="ltr">
    Still, there quite a few challenges left to be overcome in implementing this. The technology is ready and waiting, but it won’t be effective without the
    full participation of thousands of employers and educational institutions. Those Universities will have to turn decades of records into digital files, and
    provide tens or hundreds of thousands of alumni with digital diploma numbers. That’s an effort.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    This technology solves the problem of forged degrees from real universities, but using it to shut down the numerous diploma mills will require some sort of
    central authority that verifies the existence and pedigree of each university. The technology is fully functional, but Dumont will need to offer a simple
    tool for checking degrees, because the current process for verifying a diploma is a bit confusing for blockchain novices. It’s a fantastic idea and it has
    huge potential, but it’s going to take a bit of time.
</p>
<br/>
<p dir="ltr">
    Until then, you truly can be anything you want, provided you’re willing to cheat, lie, and pay for a fake degree.
