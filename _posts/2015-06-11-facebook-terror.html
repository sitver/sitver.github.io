<h2 class="graf--p" name="3c17"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">If you lost your Facebook account today, what would you lose?</strong></h2>

<p class="graf--p" name="cce0">I probe that question after reading the story of Chris Stout-Hazard, whose Facebook account was recently closed, and then subsequently reopened after his story went viral.</p>

<p class="graf--p" name="8c1d"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">When Chris&rsquo;s account was closed, he was provided the following reason: </strong>&ldquo;<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Your account was removed from Facebook because we found it&rsquo;s pretending to be someone else</em>&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="graf--p" name="a140">In losing his account, Chris lost access to <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">a lot</em> more than just a few friends and photos.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="graf--p" name="a399">He lost access to the advertising portal that sustains his business.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="graf--p" name="466e">He lost access to his company&rsquo;s popular Facebook page, to his chats with customers.</p>

<p class="graf--p" name="e37b">&nbsp;He lost access to the dozens of websites he had created accounts on using Facebook&rsquo;s Connect-auth tool.</p>

<p class="graf--p" name="15ad">And all because Facebook, in its infinite wisdom, decided that Chris wasn&rsquo;t real.</p>

<p class="graf--p" name="367a"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Chris&rsquo;s identity isn&rsquo;t easy to fake. He&rsquo;s a pretty socially-active person online.</strong></p>

<p class="graf--p" name="7b9c">&nbsp;The Person he's married to is the star of a television show. Over the years he had provided Facebook addresses, phone numbers, and even credit card numbers, in his name. He consistently logged in from his home address, and Facebook knew that (Facebook allows you to download and examine your data, and that data includes more information about you than you knew existed).</p>

<p class="graf--p" name="e600"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">And yet somehow Facebook got the idea that Chris was, as George Orwell put it in his intrepid novel 1984, an &ldquo;unperson&rdquo;.</strong></p>

<p class="graf--p" name="7b5a">They claimed that the friends he&rsquo;d connected with, the posts he&rsquo;d written, and the life he had so actively lived on Facebook was a lie, despite significant evidence to the contrary. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">That&rsquo;s scary.</strong></p>

<p class="graf--p" name="deea">One company has so much control over some of our lives, and wields that power so carelessly.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="graf--p" name="e307"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">This is precisely what Orwell warned against.</strong></p>

<p class="graf--p" name="e67a">If I lost my Facebook account, I wouldn&rsquo;t be hit as hard as Chris was, but I would certainly be devastated.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="graf--p" name="f166">Thousands of messages, photos, friends, and business connections would be gone. Access to dozens of apps and websites would be gone.</p>

<p class="graf--p" name="9627">&nbsp;Facebook pages with thousands of likes, and groups with hundreds (or even thousands) of members would be gone. My ad campaigns, my data, and my family photos (if I hadn&rsquo;t backed them up) would all be gone.</p>

<p class="graf--p" name="5ef9"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What would you lose? Fill in the blank, and tweet me back</strong></p>
