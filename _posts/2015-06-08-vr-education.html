<p>Many technologies have impacted education. The printing press. The calculator. The computer. But none, nada one, will have an impact greater than virtual reality.</p>

<p><b>Virtual Reality is here</b>, and it&rsquo;s almost ready for the classroom. With $10 Cardboard glasses, ordinary smartphones can be transformed into amazing VR devices, capable of transporting students to new worlds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With Google Cardboard&rsquo;s Expeditions, students can travel to museums and historic sites without leaving the schoolhouse, and that&rsquo;s just the beginning. Here are 20 ways that virtual reality will change the way we learn.</p>

	<li><strong>Trips to outer space: </strong>&ldquo;Today we&rsquo;ll be going to Mars&rdquo;. That is what the astronomy teacher of the future will say. We&rsquo;ve captured petabytes of advanced imagery of planets like mars and saturn, and we can now construct three-dimensional experiences that allows students to walk around the red planet, look around for themselves, and make observations.</li>
	<li><strong>Join the magic Schoolbus:</strong> If you&rsquo;ve gone to school within the last two decades, you remember &ldquo;The Magic Schoolbus&rdquo;, one of the better educational children&rsquo;s series ever made. Well class, soon you&rsquo;ll be able to join in on the fun, travelling with Ms. Frizzle inside the human body, plants, and more. We&rsquo;re actually already partway there. Netflix is rebooting the Magic Schoolbus franchise with 3D, computer-animated characters, though in this version you can&rsquo;t be part of the action.</li>
	<li><strong>Join the battle:</strong> Imagine what it must have been like on the boat, as Washington crossed the Delaware, or in WWII Europe, as the allies liberated millions. Well, students in a few years won&rsquo;t have to imagine. Thanks to new technology by Google that makes it much easier to film virtual-reality content, students will soon be able to explore the battlefields, as the battles are happening, join the troops as Washington gives a pep talk, or take a tour through the rubble that Dresden became after allied bombings in 1945.</li>

	<li><strong>Visit the museum:</strong> The world&rsquo;s best art is not in one place. It&rsquo;s spread across vast museums around the globe, from France&rsquo;s Louvre, to New York&rsquo;s Metropolitan museum of art. But Google has already captured many of the world&rsquo;s finest works and monuments in virtual reality (using Google streetview technology), allowing students to explore every crevice of the Great Pyramids on the same day they study the brush strokes on the Mona Lisa, and the prints of Andy Warhol.</li>
	<li><strong>School Projects, in VR:</strong> Remember that model airplane you constructed for a project in the 4th grade? Well, within a few years students will be blowing that out of the water. With large open-source repositories, and improving tools, creating VR experiences is getting easier every day, and that means that students may soon ditch the powerpoint for more interactive, virtual reality projects.</li>
	<li><strong>Engineering education, coming to a classroom near you: </strong>Manufacturing, and even 3D printing are expensive processes. With the addition of VR to design and engineering classrooms, students can explore their designs, from cars, to bridges, to houses, in all dimensions without the cost of manufacturing their products.</li>
	<li><strong>Math, gamified:</strong> Gamification, the process of motivating students by making education game-like, has been proven to be highly effective. With virtual reality, projects like World of Comenius are taking this to new levels.</li>
	<li><strong>Personal instruction, from Einstein: </strong>In the classroom of the future, teachers don&rsquo;t lecture; they assist. The lecturing is done in virtual reality, by expert lecturers dead and alive, from Supreme Court Justices, to scientists and economists. <em>Imagine learning about the theory of relativity from Einstein? That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m talking about.</em></li>
	<li><strong>Face to face, from 10,000 miles away:</strong> You may have had a pen pal in school. Someone far away, to write letters to. Students in a few years will have VR pals. Language and distance are no longer a barrier. With special cameras and VR devices, as well as new translation technology developed by Microsoft&rsquo;s Skype, you will soon be able to talk to anyone, in any language, in three dimensions, no matter where you or they are in the world. This offers students around the globe the opportunity to meet people of entirely different cultures, without having to travel outside school walls.</li>
	<li><strong>Adaptive, individualized education:</strong> With VR, the age of one-size-fits-all education will finally be gone. VR education software will be adaptive, made to help students learn, no matter how they learn. It makes education personal, and fun. This is the true promise of VR education, and this is why we need to get VR into the classroom as soon as possible.</li>
