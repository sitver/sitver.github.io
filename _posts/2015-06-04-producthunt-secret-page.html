</p><p>Product Hunt is my favorite website. I check it every morning, and every afternoon. I upvote. I comment. But since it's carefully curated, I often run out of products quickly.</p><p><br></p>
<p><b> Luckily, today I learned about a separate, secret section of Product Hunt. A section for the Product Hunt power-users. The <a href="http://www.producthunt.com/"Upcoming"">"Upcoming"</a> section.</b></p>
<p><br></p><p>The "Upcoming" section is where Product Hunt posts wait in limbo for a following, or for a moderator to promote it to the main site. Among today's posts is a drone-advertising business, special bike shorts, and a collaborative prototyping app.</p>

<p><br></p><p> <b>In "Upcoming" are brilliant startups that just haven't made it to the homepage yet, as well as terrible startups</b>, from spammy blogs, to genuine products that solve really weird, niche problems.</p><p><br></p>
<p> Unlike on the homepage, where you are a voter and the content has already been filtered, on "Upcoming" you are the decider. You are the curator.<b> You can give posts life.</b></p><p><br></p>

<p> <b>You are usually the first to see each idea,</b> and you have the opportunity to post the first comment (if you have commenting privileges) or give a post the first upvote.</p><p><br></p><p>Sure, I still prefer visiting the active, curated homepage to the "Upcoming" page, but reading through the "Upcoming" page is definitely a fun way to spend a few minutes each day. </p><p><br></p>
<p>(<b>Pro Tip:</b> For a good time, go to the "Upcoming" page with a friend and place bets as to which Products will succeed)</p>
