<p >Some people just need a physical keyboard for their smartphone. They can&#39;t stand typing on glass, or having to look while they type.&nbsp;</p>

<p >Until now, most of those people have turned to bluetooth keyboard cases.</p>

<p >These keyboards work pretty well, but they&#39;re a bit heavy, you have to charge them frequently, and they&#39;re a bit of a drain on your smartphone&#39;s battery.</p>

<p ><b>At New York&#39;s CE Week, I met with a company called one2TOUCH, whose solution is a bit more elegant.</b></p>

<p >one2TOUCH&#39;s Flipcover case runs off of NFC (Near-Field-Communication).&nbsp;</p>

<p >NFC chips are small circuits that run off of ambient energy emitted by your smartphone. When a key is pressed, the circuit is activated, sending a signal to your phone. Bluetooth, on the other hand, is always on, always connected.</p>

<p >Using NFC eliminates the need for an on-keyboard battery, and the need for bluetooth on your phone. This saves weight, and energy, making one2TOUCH&#39;s covers very light.</p>

<p ><b>Of course, this method has its downsides.</b>&nbsp;Many phones don&#39;t have NFC technology installed. Bluetooth keyboards are cheap and readily available. The NFC keyboard is new, and not yet on the market.</p>

<p >Still, I think this is a promising use of NFC, and I look forward to the other ways that people will use NFC for accessories.</p>
